We're Bhathals&Co, a small family business that started during the COVID pandemic.  We  specialise in buying, managing and letting properties in the West Midlands area. Currently the team is made of a son and father duo Josh and Balvir Bhathal. They value honesty and integrity and this is seen thorugh the business decisions they make.
